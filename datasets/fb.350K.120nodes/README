This pub/sub workload is compiled based on a subset of Facebook traces provided
by UCSB CURRENT research group.

The present dataset is designed for a distributed broker-based system in which
user profiles are hosted by pub/sub separate brokers and each broker subscribes
to the activities performed by friends of the users that it hosts (on their
behalf). The dataset parameters are as follows:

  - number of brokers (broker-no): 120
  - number of users (user-no): 350,000
  - number of subscriptions (subs-no): 125,612
  - number of publication (pubs-no): 50,024
  - number of deliveries: 1.22 million



The compilation process is as follows:

  - A subset of user-no of unique users has been randomly picked and the social
    graph (friendships) and interaction graph (wall posts) present in the
    Facebook traces has been contracted to include these users only.

  - The selected users were assigned uniformly between brokers.
  
  - Subscriptions local to each broker were then constructed according to the
    identifiers of friends of each user assigned to that broker (based on social
    graph traces).

  - Publications are then constructed based on the interaction graphs such that
    each publication matches friends of the user who wrote the wall post as well
    as the friends of the user who received the post.

The number of hosts/users can be configured and the pub/sub dataset be
recompiled accordingly from the original user traces using our scripts. However,
due to privacy issues we are unable to distribute original user traces and
scripts for recompiling the dataset. If you wish access to a new dataset with
different parameters please contact us with the specifics of your request. We
try our best to accommodate your requests.

Thanks,
